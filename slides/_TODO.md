### Don't test too much
- What should be tested
- Separating implementation and interface
- How can I tell if I'm testing impl
note:
- ajax: check success/failure
- don't test backing details
  - helper functions, data structures
  - those should already be tested!
    - even if they aren't, if it still works...

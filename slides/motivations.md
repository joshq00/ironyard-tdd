## Motivations

note:
- Let's talk about _why_ we test


### Why do we test?


#### Confidence

note:
- At all times, know that it still works
- Know _how_ it's broken, within seconds
  - Ever change some code and spend hours figuring out
    why something broke?
- Better test coverage usually = fewer defects
